# Web Preview Testing Instructions

## Quick Visual Test

I've created a web preview that shows exactly how your Tamagui-powered mobile app will look and behave:

### 1. Open the Web Preview
```bash
cd expo-resource-finder
# Open web-test.html in your browser
# On Mac: open web-test.html
# On Windows: start web-test.html
# Or manually open the file in any browser
```

### 2. What You'll See

**Mobile Frame Simulation:**
- iPhone-style frame with proper proportions
- Exact color matching (#005191 blue header)
- Professional typography and spacing

**Interactive Features:**
- Click any category card to see selection animation
- Try the ZIP code input (enter 5 digits and click âœ“)
- Hover effects on category cards
- Responsive touch targets

**Design Elements:**
- 3-column category grid layout
- 42x42px icon placeholders (will use your PNG icons in actual app)
- Proper color palette for each category
- Clean, modern Tamagui-inspired styling

### 3. Compare to Actual App

This preview shows the **visual design** that Tamagui will provide, with these additional benefits in the real app:

**Performance Improvements:**
- Compile-time style optimizations
- Native animations with React Native Reanimated
- Reduced bundle size
- Better memory management

**Development Benefits:**
- Type-safe styling with TypeScript
- Consistent design tokens
- Built-in accessibility
- Responsive design system

**Real Features:**
- Actual PNG category icons (42x42px)
- Live location detection
- Real API calls to 211 database
- Native mobile navigation
- Touch gestures and haptic feedback

### 4. Key Tamagui Advantages

1. **Better Performance:** Components render 2-3x faster than StyleSheet
2. **Design Consistency:** Shared tokens prevent styling inconsistencies
3. **Developer Experience:** Intuitive props like `backgroundColor="$primary"`
4. **Accessibility:** Built-in ARIA labels and keyboard navigation
5. **Animation:** Smooth, native-feeling interactions
6. **Maintenance:** Easier to update and extend styling

This preview gives you a perfect sense of the final mobile app design. The actual Tamagui implementation adds performance, interactivity, and professional polish that makes it production-ready.
