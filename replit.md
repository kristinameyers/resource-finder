# Resource Finder Application

## Overview

This is a full-stack web application that helps users find community resources in their area. The application allows users to search for resources by category, subcategory, and location, with data sourced from both a local database and the National 211 API. It features a modern React frontend with a Node.js/Express backend and uses PostgreSQL for data storage.

## User Preferences

Preferred communication style: Simple, everyday language.

## System Architecture

The application follows a modern full-stack architecture with clear separation between frontend and backend responsibilities:

### Frontend Architecture
- **Framework**: React 18 with TypeScript
- **Routing**: Wouter for client-side routing
- **Styling**: Tailwind CSS with shadcn/ui component library
- **State Management**: TanStack Query for server state management
- **Build Tool**: Vite for development and production builds

### Backend Architecture
- **Framework**: Express.js with TypeScript
- **Database ORM**: Drizzle ORM with PostgreSQL
- **Database Provider**: Neon serverless PostgreSQL
- **Session Management**: Anonymous voting using client-side session IDs
- **External Services**: Firebase Firestore for voting data, National 211 API integration

## Key Components

### Database Schema
- **Users Table**: Basic user authentication (currently minimal usage)
- **Ratings Table**: Anonymous voting system with session-based tracking
- **Resource Data**: Primarily sourced from National 211 API with local categorization

### Authentication & Authorization
- **Anonymous Access**: No user authentication required for core functionality
- **Session-based Voting**: Anonymous voting using client-generated session IDs
- **IP Address Tracking**: Additional layer for vote deduplication

### Data Sources
- **Primary**: National 211 API (Search V2) for real-time resource data
- **Secondary**: Local storage for categories, subcategories, and location mappings
- **Voting Data**: Firebase Firestore for distributed vote storage

### Location Services
- **Browser Geolocation**: HTML5 Geolocation API for current location
- **Zip Code Search**: Manual location entry with coordinate lookup
- **Distance Filtering**: Location-based resource filtering

## Data Flow

1. **Resource Discovery**: Users browse categories or enter location data
2. **API Integration**: System queries National 211 API with taxonomy codes and location parameters
3. **Data Enrichment**: Resources are enhanced with local category mappings and voting data
4. **Client Rendering**: React components display filtered and sorted results
5. **User Interaction**: Anonymous voting and favorites are stored locally/in Firestore

## External Dependencies

### Core Services
- **National 211 API**: Primary data source for community resources
- **Neon Database**: Serverless PostgreSQL hosting
- **Firebase Firestore**: Voting and analytics data storage

### Development & UI
- **Radix UI**: Accessible component primitives
- **Tailwind CSS**: Utility-first CSS framework
- **shadcn/ui**: Pre-built component library
- **TanStack Query**: Server state management and caching

### Location & Mapping
- **Browser Geolocation API**: Current location detection
- **Coordinate-based Search**: Geographic filtering of resources

## Deployment Strategy

### Development
- **Local Development**: Vite dev server with Express API
- **Hot Reload**: Real-time updates during development
- **Environment Variables**: Database and API credentials management

### Production Build
- **Frontend**: Vite builds static assets to `dist/public`
- **Backend**: esbuild bundles Express server to `dist/index.js`
- **Deployment**: Single server deployment with static file serving

### Database Management
- **Schema**: Drizzle migrations in `./migrations` directory
- **Deployment**: `drizzle-kit push` for schema updates
- **Connection**: Serverless connection pooling with Neon

The application prioritizes user experience with fast loading times, anonymous access, and real-time data from authoritative sources while maintaining a clean, accessible interface.
