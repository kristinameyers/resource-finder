Instructions for Replit
1. Stop Deploying Further Changes Immediately
Do not push additional code until you’ve done a step-by-step review.

2. Restore the Resource Functionality From Yesterday
Identify the specific commit or file(s) from yesterday (when resource categories and lists worked correctly).

Use your version control/git history (e.g., git log, GitHub/Bitbucket UI).

Look for recent commits for resources, category click, or API/data fetching logic.

Restore all affected backend and frontend files handling:

Resource fetching/filtering (API endpoints, database logic).

Frontend resource display and category click handlers.

Any Redux/context/data loader logic and related utility functions.

Test that categories display resources as expected (as of yesterday).

3. Keep Today's UI and CSS Changes
Preserve all CSS/layout and UI refactor updates made today:

Navigation bar redesign, new button styling, background fixes, slide-out menu, etc.

Do NOT roll back new UI/UX code—only restore business/resource logic.

4. Manually Merge or Cherry-Pick Where Needed
If both UI and resource logic changed in the same file, manually:

Copy-paste or merge the resource-relevant functions/handlers from the working version (yesterday) into the current UI-updated version (today).

Carefully avoid overwriting the style/layout work done today.

For files that only contain resource logic, simply revert or cherry-pick them.

5. Test Thoroughly
After merging, test the following:

Resource category clicks show correct resources.

Resource lists and filters work as they did yesterday.

All today’s design changes remain visible and functioning.

6. Last Steps: Version Control and Future Guardrails
Commit this fixed, working state with a clear message (e.g., "Restore resource listing function, preserve UI updates (merge 2025-08-20 & 2025-08-19 changes)").

Tag the working commit or save a backup for fallback.

Add a team note:

“When major UI changes are made, verify all core functionality (category, resource listing, filtering, etc.) before merging or deploying. Use git branches to keep UI and logic changes separate.”

Summary for Replit
Find where yesterday’s working resource logic was broken or overwritten.

Restore that logic without touching the new UI/CSS/layout from today.

Test both display and filtering, then commit as a new, stable working version.

If you need further help identifying which files/commits to restore or need an example workflow (e.g., git cherry-pick or git checkout for certain files), just ask!
