Critical Issues with Latest Update – Immediate Action Required
All Categories Display, But No Resources Appear

Every category shows in the UI, but selecting one only displays “no resources found.”

This resource-fetching logic was working in the previous version—this must be restored.

Distance Calculations Feature Missing

The functionality to compute and display the distance between the user and each resource is gone.

This was previously developed and working—restore it immediately.

Listing Page Design Regression

The correct design for the resource listing page was replaced or removed.

You were NOT supposed to overwrite the existing design—restore the prior listing page design.

Specific Instructions
Restore Resource Fetching Logic:
Revert or copy over the resource list fetching, display, and category navigation logic from the last working version (previous commit or backup), so that selecting a category correctly displays resources again.

Reinstate Distance Calculations:
Bring back the distance calculation and sorting for resources. If the user provides location information, resources must display sorted from closest to farthest, with the calculated distance shown for each result.

Return to the Previous Listing Page UI:
Bring back the listing page layout/design that existed before today’s changes. Only keep new UI elements that were specifically approved. Do NOT remove or drastically alter the previous resource card layout, filters, distance display, etc.

Preserve Today’s Approved UI Updates:
Keep the following changes from today, unless they conflict with restoring working functionality:

Updated navigation bar (with icons and styling, global presence)

Button design and background color improvements

Slide out menu matching new design

Do Not Remove or Alter Core Functionality when applying additional style changes in the future.
All business logic (resource fetching, distance, filters) must remain intact unless a change is explicitly requested and approved.

Test before merging or deploying:

Select any category and verify resources are displayed.

Confirm distance sorting and proximity display.

Check that the resource listing page looks like your previously approved design.

Summary:
Restore working resource features (including distance and listing page design) without reverting or overwriting new nav/menu/button UI. Do not sacrifice core functionality for new layout or style changes.

If you are unable to resolve this, please escalate or provide a detailed list of which files and commits were changed so I can assist with an exact restoration plan.
