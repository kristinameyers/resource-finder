Certainly! Here’s a clear set of instructions you can provide to Replit for updating your bottom navigation bar so that it matches the visual design in your screenshot, **while keeping all the navigation logic and destinations exactly the same**.

## Instructions to Update Bottom Nav Bar Design (Replit – Vibe Code/React)

**Goal:**  
Redesign the bottom navigation bar to match the design in the provided screenshot. Functionality (routes, navigation targets, etc.) must remain unchanged—this is a style/UI update only.

***

### 1. Visual Design Requirements:

- **Background:**  
  The nav bar background and icon containers use a two-tone blue scheme. The nav background is a lighter blue; each button uses a dark blue rounded square container.

- **Buttons:**  
  Each button (icon + label) is inside its own dark blue rounded rectangle with notable border radius/corner rounding.

- **Icons:**  
  Each button has a white icon:  
    - Magnifying glass for "Search"  
    - Heart for "Favorites"  
    - Phone or receiver for "Search" (likely for "Contact" or "Call")  
    - User group for "About"  
    - Gear for "Settings"
  - Use a consistent icon library (e.g., Material Icons, Ionicons) and match icon shapes to screenshot.

- **Labels:**  
  White text labels are below or beside each icon within the button container.

- **Button Spacing:**  
  Even spacing between buttons; each button separated from the others, not touching.

- **Elevation/Shadow:**  
  Subtle shadow or elevation and a clean look.

***

### 2. Technical Implementation Suggestions

- **Component Structure:**
    - The entire nav bar sits inside a light blue container.
    - Each button is a `TouchableOpacity` or `Button` inside a view with:
        - Dark blue background (`#152941` or similar)
        - High `borderRadius` (24–32px)
        - Padding to make icons/labels not touch edges
        - Icon above or beside label

- **Sample Styled Button (React Native/JSX-like Pseudocode):**
  ```jsx
  
    
      
        
        Search
      
      {/* Repeat for each nav button */}
    
  
  ```
  With example styles:
  ```js
  const styles = {
    bottomNavContainer: {
      backgroundColor: '#66A8DD', // match screenshot base color
      padding: 12,
    },
    navBar: {
      flexDirection: 'row',
      justifyContent: 'space-around',
      alignItems: 'center'
    },
    navButton: {
      backgroundColor: '#152941',
      borderRadius: 20,
      alignItems: 'center',
      width: 64,
      height: 64,
      justifyContent: 'center',
      marginHorizontal: 8,
    },
    navLabel: {
      color: '#fff',
      marginTop: 4,
      fontSize: 14,
    },
  }
  ```

### 3. What Replit Needs to Do

1. **Replace** the bottom nav bar's button containers so each looks like the screenshot.
2. **Use dark blue rounded rectangles** as backgrounds for all icon/label buttons.
3. **Update icon set** to match shapes and white color from the screenshot.
4. **Apply the light blue background** to the nav bar itself, with correct padding/margins.
5. **Maintain all navigation logic**: routes, active highlighting, onPress handlers must all work as before.

***

### 4. What Not To Change

- **Navigation targets, routing logic, and button count remain exactly the same.**
- **No new routes or nav buttons are required**—strictly a style and layout update.

***

### 5. Reference
See the provided screenshot for all colors, spacing, icon placement, and button shape details.

***

**Summary:**  
Redesign the bottom nav bar per the screenshot: light blue background, five dark blue rounded rectangle buttons with white icons and text, evenly spaced, **without changing how navigation works**.
