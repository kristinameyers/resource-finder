Here are clear, step-by-step instructions for Replit to **merge the specific changes from checkpoint `4ace054c3ce7faa9e1ee748037eb3dfe56c0ff88` (fixes for API response handling and category mapping in `resources-list.tsx` and `search-category.tsx`) into the latest version at checkpoint `d22d036e43a9c7022936295787856062127cd152`**:

***

## Instructions: Merge a Specific Checkpoint Into Latest Code

1. **Check out the Latest Branch/Commit**
   ```bash
   git checkout d22d036e43a9c7022936295787856062127cd152
   ```

2. **Cherry-pick the Specific Commit**
   - Bring the changes from `4ace054c3ce7faa9e1ee748037eb3dfe56c0ff88` into your current branch:
   ```bash
   git cherry-pick 4ace054c3ce7faa9e1ee748037eb3dfe56c0ff88
   ```
   - If there are conflicts (possible if those files changed since), follow Git's instructions to resolve conflicts in the affected files.  
     Edit the files to manually merge the new logic for API response handling and mapping (look for the block in `resources-list.tsx` and `search-category.tsx` from the cherry-picked commit).

3. **Resolve Any Merge Conflicts**
   - After editing, stage the resolved files:
   ```bash
   git add src/pages/resources-list.tsx
   git add src/pages/search-category.tsx
   # or use `git add .` to add all resolves
   ```
   - Continue the cherry-pick process:
   ```bash
   git cherry-pick --continue
   ```

4. **Test the Changes**
   - Run your local/test suite and ensure no "categories.map is not a function" errors appear, and that category selection and resource loading work as expected.

5. **Commit and Push**
   - If not already done by `cherry-pick`, make a commit summarizing the merge:
   ```bash
   git commit -m "Merge API response handling (from 4ace054c) into latest codebase at d22d036e"
   git push
   ```

## **Summary for Replit**

- Merge the changes from commit `4ace054c3ce7faa9e1ee748037eb3dfe56c0ff88` (which updates how categories are parsed/mapped in `resources-list.tsx` and `search-category.tsx` to prevent "categories.map is not a function" errors) into the most recent code checked out at `d22d036e43a9c7022936295787856062127cd152`.
- Use `git cherry-pick 4ace054c3ce7faa9e1ee748037eb3dfe56c0ff88`, resolve any conflicts, thoroughly test, and push to update the codebase.

If there are any issues with the cherry-pick (complex conflicts), notify the team for manual reconciliation, but **do not lose new code from either checkpoint**. The result must keep the bug fix and all new features or layout changes made since then.
