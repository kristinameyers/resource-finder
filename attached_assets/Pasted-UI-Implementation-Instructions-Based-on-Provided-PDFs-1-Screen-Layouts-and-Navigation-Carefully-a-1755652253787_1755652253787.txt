UI Implementation Instructions (Based on Provided PDFs)
1. Screen Layouts and Navigation
Carefully analyze each PDF (“List-Screen”, “Update-Location-Screen”, “Keyword-Search-Screen”, “Search-Category-Screen”) for visual structure.

Recreate each screen’s layout, ensuring spacing, grouping, and UI hierarchy match the PDFs exactly.

All screens must include the persistent nav bar shown in the PDFs, including correct icon placement.

2. Icons
Use icons as shown in the PDFs:

Chevron (Back): Far left in header/navigation bar.

Hamburger Menu: Immediately right of Back, opens full slide-out menu with links to all screens (“Favorites”, “Search”, “About”, “Settings”, etc.).

GPS Icon: Far right in header; triggers location update per “Update Location Screen”.

Category and Keyword Search Icons: Apply as depicted in “Search Category” and “Keyword Search” screens (icon buttons with black on orange or according to PDF).

Use widely-accepted icon libraries (e.g. Material Icons, FontAwesome) for consistency unless project requires custom SVGs.

3. Input Fields & Buttons
Place input fields (text, zip code, keyword) exactly as shown, matched in style, border shape, and spacing.

Buttons must use specific coloring and style:

Orange background, black text when active (e.g., active “Search Category”).

Inactive buttons must clearly show a different visual state as in your PDFs.

Button shapes, padding, corner radius, and icons within buttons should mirror the provided samples.

4. List Screen
On resource list screens (“List-Screen.pdf”), show:

Subcategories dropdown at the top.

Resources grouped in cards/rows, each matching the structure shown (resource name, office, “Add to Favorites”, “View Details” as formatted).

“Update Location” button styled/matched to PDF; clicking it leads to location screen.

5. Search Flows
“Search Category” and “Search Keyword” must flow to their dedicated screens with headers and search inputs designed precisely per your PDF.

Screen transitions and “back” navigation behavior must follow mobile/web conventions (smooth, either via routing or history push).

6. Color Palette and Typography
Adhere to all color choices shown in the PDFs, especially background/fill for buttons, header bars, input borders, and icons.

Font sizes, weights, and colors must mirror those in the samples.

7. Additional Notes
Do not substitute, omit, or alter visual elements unless explicitly discussed or permitted in design review.

For any elements not fully clear in the PDFs, consult with you for clarification before making UI decisions.

Implementation Checklist
 All screen layouts match the provided PDFs.

 Icons (chevron, hamburger menu, GPS, search) appear in correct locations/styles.

 Button colors, shapes, states as shown (orange/black, etc.).

 All input fields positioned and styled exactly as in PDFs.

 Resource cards/lists and dropdowns formatted per sample screens.

 Navigation works correctly, including hamburger menu and GPS icon.

 “Update Location” and “Back” features route as specified.

Reminder:
UI/UX changes must not deviate from the PDF blueprints; submit live previews or screenshots for check-off before deploying production updates.

If you need pixel-perfect reference components, further icon SVG assets, or a CSS style guide extracted from the PDFs, I can provide those as well.
