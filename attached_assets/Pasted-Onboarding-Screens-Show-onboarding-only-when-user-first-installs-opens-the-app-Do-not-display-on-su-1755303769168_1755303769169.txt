Onboarding Screens
Show onboarding only when user first installs/opens the app. Do not display on subsequent launches.

Onboarding flow screens (see attachments for visuals):

Screen 1: Welcome screen.

Screen 2: Zip code entry.

User enters zip code to customize results OR can skip this screen.

Screen 3: Category selection.

Prompt user to choose up to 3 favorite resource categories.

The selected categories should be sorted to appear at the top on the Home Screen, below "Browse all Categories".

Implementation Notes:

After onboarding completes, store a persistent flag (e.g., in AsyncStorage) so onboarding does NOT repeat.

The Home Screen should use these onboarding selections as described.

Taxonomy Code Search Changes
Remove restriction for "serving" specific postal codes.

Display all resources where county_name = Santa Barbara for the selected taxonomy code (category).

Use provided database columns:

zip, lat, lng, county_name — use these to determine Santa Barbara county zip codes and calculate user-to-resource distance.

Filter by distance ONLY if user provides zip code or uses location detection:

When zip is entered or location is detected, sort resources by closest to farthest.

Location detection currently throws "Failed to get current location" error—address/fix if possible.

Parameter & UI Updates
Resource List Page:
Replace parameter serviceName with orgName.

Resource Detail Page:
Add orgName (Organization Name).

Remove organizationDescription (About this Resource).

Replace with descriptionService (About this Resource).

Resource Filters:
Remove "Resource Filters" and "Enter Keyword" sections from the top of the resource list page.

Only show these filters on the Home Screen.

Requests to Replit
Do NOT make changes to navigation logic, resource filters, or category sorting beyond what is specified above.

Do NOT display onboarding screens after the initial app launch.

DO NOT add postal code filtering to taxonomy search unless the user provides location or zip.

DO use selections from onboarding for customizing the Home Screen as described.

Summary:
Add a three-screen onboarding flow shown only once, update taxonomy search and resource screens as specified (not exceeding these changes), and ensure all adjustments precisely follow the instructions above without introducing new behaviors or changes outside this scope.
