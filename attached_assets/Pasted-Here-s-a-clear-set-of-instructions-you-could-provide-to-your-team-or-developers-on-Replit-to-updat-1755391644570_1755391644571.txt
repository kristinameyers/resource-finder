Here’s a clear set of instructions you could provide to your team (or developers on Replit) to update the taxonomy codes for your main categories, while keeping subcategories unchanged:

### Instructions for Updating Taxonomy Codes (Main Categories Only)

We are updating the taxonomy codes associated with our **Level 1 (Main) Categories**.  

- **Important**: Only update the main category codes listed below.  
- **Do NOT change the Level 2 (Subcategory) codes** — they remain the same.  
- Use the "taxonomy code" keyword process when linking categories.

***

### Updated Mapping of Main Categories → Taxonomy Codes

- **Housing** → `BH-1800`  
- **Finance & Employment** → `NL-1000`  
- **Food** → `BD-1800.2000`  
- **Health Care** → `LN`  
- **Mental Wellness** → `RP-1400`  
- **Substance Use** → `RX-8250`  
- **Children & Family** → `PH`  
- **Young Adults** → `PS-9800`  
- **Education** → `HD-1800.8000`  
- **Legal Assistance** → `FT`  
- **Transportation** → `BT-4500`

### Process Steps

1. Locate the **taxonomy code field/property** linked to each **Level 1 (Main Category)** in the system.  
2. Replace the existing code with the updated code from the list above.  
3. Do **not** alter or overwrite taxonomy codes associated with Level 2 (Subcategories). They should remain mapped exactly as they are.  
4. Validate after update:
   - Confirm each main category reflects its new taxonomy code.  
   - Ensure all subcategories are still correctly mapped and unaffected.

### Example Implementation Notes

- If the main categories are stored in a JSON or database table, update only the top-level `"taxonomyCode"` value for each category.  
- If you’re using a keyword matching process (e.g., `"taxonomy code": "BH-1800"`), ensure the new codes replace the old ones at that level.  
- Run a test by pulling taxonomy data for one or two main categories to confirm only the top-level codes updated.

Would you like me to also **write a code snippet (example in JSON or Python)** that Replit developers can directly use to perform this update safely?
