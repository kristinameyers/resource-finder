## ðŸš€ Next Steps for App Store Deployment

### 1. Install Dependencies
```bash
cd expo-resource-finder
npm install
```

### 2. Create Required App Icons
You need to create these files in `assets/`:
- `icon.png` (1024x1024) - Main app icon
- `adaptive-icon.png` (1024x1024) - Android adaptive icon
- `splash.png` (1284x2778) - Launch screen
- `favicon.png` (48x48) - Web favicon

**Design Specs:**
- Use your brand colors (#005191 blue background)
- Include "Resource Finder" or "RF" text
- Keep design simple and recognizable at small sizes

### 3. Test Locally
```bash
npm start
```
Then scan QR code with Expo Go app on your phone.

### 4. Configure Bundle Identifiers
Update `app.json`:
- iOS: `"bundleIdentifier": "com.yourcompany.resourcefinder"`
- Android: `"package": "com.yourcompany.resourcefinder"`

Replace `yourcompany` with your actual company/organization name.
